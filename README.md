# RocketRob

## Summary
RocketRob is a Unity game that was released to the IOS App Store through Aphy Games. The game is a pixelated 2D platform-style that depicts a character named Rob attempting to reach as high as possible in the sky! He is equipped with a rocket launcher that rapidly propels him away from the fired rocket, which is his main form of gaining height. He needs to dodge heat-seeking spike bombs and massive falling meteors and grab power-ups to help his mission. The inspiration for the game came from the classics Doodle Jump, Flappy Bird, and Jetpack Joyride.
